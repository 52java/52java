Zirui Zhuang received his B.Eng. in electronic information engineering, and Ph.D. in information and communication engineering from Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications[[中文]](http://www.bupt.edu.cn/)[[English]](https://english.bupt.edu.cn/), in 2015 and 2020, respectively. He is advised by Professor [Jingyu Wang](https://teacher.bupt.edu.cn/wangjingyu/en/lwcg/59169/list/index.htm) during his course of Ph.D. study. 

He currently is with the State Key Laboratory of Networking and Switching Technology[[中文]](http://sklnst.bupt.edu.cn/)[[English]](https://sklnst-en.bupt.edu.cn/). He is also with the [School of Computer Science](https://scs.bupt.edu.cn/) starting from 2020. He was also with the [Institute of Network Technology](https://int.bupt.edu.cn/) from 2015 to 2020. 

In 2019, he visited the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Houston, doing research on network routing and optimization, advised by Professor [Zhu Han](http://www2.egr.uh.edu/~zhan2/).

His research interests include network routing and management for next generation network infrastructures, using machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques, including deep learning, reinforcement learning, graph representation, multi-agent system, and Lyapunov-based optimization.

Recently, he has been focusing on the design of Knowledge-Defined Networking (KDN) framework which employs artificial intelligence (AI) for the next-generation networks (AI4Network), in settings of wired computer networks as well as wireless communication networks. The integration of knowledge promotes profound intelligence in networked systems by acquisition, extraction, optimization, and application of the best practices of network control and resource management. This new paradigm demands for more advanced theory, techniques, and procedures in the aspects of sensing, modelling, decision making, and interpretation, where the combination of human intelligence and artificial intelligence is a must. While there has been a trending research interest over the convergence of communication, computation, and control, the era of KDN and AI4Network is still at its early stage. There are broad but challenging research opportunities to be explored. 

He is an active member of computer communication and signal processing communities. He joined the IEEE as a Graduate Student Member in 2018, and he became a professional Member in 2020. He is a reviwer for many high impact journals and international conferences, such as 
 - IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications 
 - IEEE Internet of Things Journal 
 - IEEE Systems Journal 
 - Scientific Reports 
 - Ad Hoc & Sensor Wireless Networks 
 - IEEE ICCC 2020
 - MobiQuitous 2019
